#+title: Leetcode
#+author: Atri Hegde

Due to my habits of trying to make my code as beautiful/effecient as possible,
I usually go ahead and scour the internet after solving the problem for insipiration,
or better solution by other. This usually results in destruction of the original code.
Therefore I will be making a copy of the original ~main.rs~ file before making further
enhancements to my solutions.
